# FreeCodeCamp challenge: Build Recipe Box

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and it uses [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/) for state management, and [react-bootstrap](http://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for the styled components.
